    <h3> CodePlayground </h3>
    <p>This repo contains source for assignments that I've had to complete, and a lot of interview practice algorithms. This repo serves almost like a time machine for me. I have included code from when I first started programming, and it helps me remember how much progress I've made.  </p>

    <h3> Data Analysis </h3>
    <p>Data Analysis has been interesting to me ever since I came to the realization that data is EVERYWHERE. This repo contains a collection of some Data Analysis projects I've been able to work on. The scripts there are written in R or Python. I've had the opportunity to work with Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, and Pig on AWS.</p>
